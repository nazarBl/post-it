Libray "multer" used to work with uploading files

===================================diskStorage===================================
destination - runs when file is uploading describe where to store files
fileName - runs when file is uploading to describe name of file before upload

multer.diskStorage({ - mthod creates storage for files (image storage in this project)
    destination: (_, __, cb)=>{
        cb(null, 'uploads') null means we not get error, "uploads" - name of folder where to store files
    },
    filename (_, file, cb)=>{
        cb(null, file.originalname) with no errors set file name to value of "originalname"-key from "file"
    }
})

cosnt upload = multer({storage: <storage name>}) - variable "upload" now can be used to work with multer storage

upload.single('image') - "single" is middleware of multer which wait for file with name 'image'
this middleware also creates key "file" in express request which holds properties of uploading file

when creating form-data "post"-request use image-<file to upload> as key-value
